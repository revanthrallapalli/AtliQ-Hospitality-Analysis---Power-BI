# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis-Power-BI
Created Dashboard by using Power BI and Excel

# Project Overview
🔸AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.\
🔸Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Observations
🔸Mumbai is the most profitable city, with a revenue of 669 million, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.\
🔸Delhi has the highest occupancy rate with 60.5%.\
🔸AtliQ Exotica performs better compared to all 7 types of properties with 316 million revenue, average rating of 3.62, occupancy percentage of 57, and cancellation rate as 24%.\
🔸AtliQ Blu has the highest occupancy rate with 62%.\
🔸Luxury category hotels generated 61% of revenue, whereas business category hotels only generated 38% overall.\
🔸The revenue for Week 27 and Week 28 was the highest among all, with a total of around 139.5 million. \
🔸AtliQ Seasons earned the lowest revenue among all 7 types of properties, with just 5 million, and a low average rating of 2.31. \
🔸AtliQ Grands have highest cancellation rate of 28% among all 7 types of properties. \
🔸AtliQ lost around 200 Million in cancellation. \

# Recommendations
🔸Promotional offers can be offered by AtliQ to customers who visit/book hotels directly on their site or offline. This can increase their revenue atlest 10%.\
🔸They need to focus on customer ratings, which have a direct impact on revenue generation. \
🔸Delhi's lack of revenue means that they have to advertise their brands at historical sites. \
🔸It's important to address booking cancellations since they lost almost 200 million in revenue within three months.
